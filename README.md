# silverstripe-gridfield-addnew-manymanythrough

Requirements: Silverstripe ^4 or ^5

Module adding functionality to Silverstripe grid fields. Adds a new button which triggers a modal, displaying a searchable list of objects. 

User clicks on one of these to create a new object for the grid field with a many_many_through relationship setup with the object selected from the list.

SS4 and many_many_through compatibility, and otherwise inspired by sheadawson/silverstripe-quickaddnew.
